## Chess Game

Game developed during a java course, offered on udemy and taught by professor Nelio Alves.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`:the folder to keep fonts, which perhaps has 4 more folders inside, where you have the application, board game, chess and chess pieces.
- `.vscode`: this folder is for storing development environment specific settings related to VSCode.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
